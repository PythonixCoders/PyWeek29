## How to Play

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./run.py
```

Or in a virtual environement :

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/PythonixCoders/PyWeek29.git butterfly-destroyer
cd butterfly-destroyer
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

The keyboard controls are simple : 
 - WASD or arrows to move
 - Space or enter to shoot
 - Shift to change weapons after unlock

But the game is better with a controler, 
however it was only tested with an Xbox controler
and there is no garanty that it will work with
correct mappings on others.
 - Main sticks to move
 - A/B or RB/LB to shoot
 - X/Y to change weapons after unlock
