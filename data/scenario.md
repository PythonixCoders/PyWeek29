## Scenario and level design

#### Intro - Done

In the year 20XX, the butterfly
overpopulation problem has
obviously reached critical mass.
The military has decided to intervene.
Your mission is simple: defeat all the
butterflies before the world ends.
But look out for Big Butta, king of
the butterflies...

#### Tuto

We need a simple was to show the controls without tooo much text
Should not be too long to go through as controls are simple and usual

Explain
 - Note: The game is played better with a gamepad
 - Basic movement (WASD, arrows or gamepad)
 - Fire (space, enter, gamepad trigger, gamepad A or B)
Don't explain how to switch weapons as there is only one available

#### Level 1 - Done

**Title**: The Butterflies Awaken

A few butterflies spawn in simple structures,
but very soon they start to organise themselves
into more complexe and dense structures
At the end the player faces a wall of non moving butterlies

#### Level 2

**Title**: The Rise of Butterfly

A few dense structures and then butterflies start
moving in increasingly complexe shape.
Finally a Machine Gun is given to the player that allows
it to destrow the final wall. 
When the machine Gun is give a small tuto
 tells how to change weapons

#### Level 3

**Title**: Attack of the Butterflies

One night, the butterflies gathered to stop you.
A very dense level were the Machine will be of 
great use, with heart powerup. Quite lengthy, 
with new structures and more butterflies than ever.
Over time, attacks are less dense but butterflies move faster
Towards the end, the player is given the Laser Gun 
to kill butterflies before they can see him.

#### Level 4

**Title**: The Butterfly Menace

After the mass killings, butterflies went 
hiding in the desert where they will try to avoid 
the player. 
Very sparse and spread out waves at first,
they then come in a bigger number and avoiding better
when the player is given Aiming bullets. 
The rest of the level is then to enjoy the Aiming bullets

#### Level 5

**Title**: The Butterflies Strikes Back

After their last beating,
they put their hands on guns and 
start to attack the player. 
A few butterflies spawn first so 
the player can learn to avoid bullets.
The machine gun will be used a lot to avoid
getting too many butterflies on the screen
There should be some snipers (butterflies far from the crowd)

#### Level 6
**Title**: A new Butterfly

#### Level 7
**Title**: Revenge of the Butterfly
#### Level 8
**Title**: Return of the Butterfly
#### Level 9
**Title**: The Last Butterfly
